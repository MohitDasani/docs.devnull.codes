# üîê Kerberoasting vs AS-REP Roasting

## üßæ Overview

Both Kerberoasting and AS-REP Roasting are offline Kerberos-based attacks in Active Directory environments aimed at retrieving password hashes and cracking them offline. Here's a detailed comparison:

| **Purpose**                    | Crack service account passwords by requesting service tickets (TGS)              | Crack user account passwords by requesting AS-REP responses                      |
| **Target Accounts**            | Domain accounts with **Service Principal Names (SPNs)**                         | User accounts with **‚ÄúDo not require Kerberos pre-authentication‚Äù** setting     |

## üîç Descriptive Explanation

### üß® Kerberoasting ‚Äì In Detail

- An attacker with **any domain account** can query for **service accounts with SPNs**.
- The attacker then requests a **TGS** for the service using Kerberos.
- The **TGS is encrypted with the NTLM hash** of the service account‚Äôs password.
- The attacker dumps the TGS and **brute-forces the hash offline** using tools like Hashcat.
- If the password is weak, it can be cracked, revealing the service account‚Äôs credentials.

> üìò **Example**: A backup service account (`svc_backup`) has an SPN like `MSSQLSvc/db.srv.domain.com`. An attacker gets the TGS for that SPN and cracks it offline.

---

### üß® AS-REP Roasting ‚Äì In Detail

- Some user accounts in AD might have the **‚ÄúDo not require Kerberos pre-authentication‚Äù** option enabled (bad practice).
- An attacker doesn‚Äôt need credentials ‚Äì they just **enumerate users** with that setting.
- The attacker sends a **fake AS-REQ** pretending to be that user.
- AD responds with an **AS-REP message**, encrypted with the user‚Äôs password hash.
- The attacker **cracks this AS-REP offline** to recover the user‚Äôs password.

> üìò **Example**: A test user (`test1`) has no pre-auth enabled. An attacker sends an AS-REQ and receives a response encrypted with the NTLM hash, then cracks it.

## üõ°Ô∏è Summary Comparison

| Attack Type         | Privileged Access   | Account Type Targeted     | Offline Cracking | Ease of Exploitation |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Kerberoasting**   | ‚úÖ Yes               | Service Accounts (SPNs)   | ‚úÖ Yes           | üü° Medium              |
| **AS-REP Roasting** | ‚ùå No (Anonymous)    | Users without pre-auth     | ‚úÖ Yes           | üü¢ Easy                |

---

## üß∞ Recommended Mitigations

### For Both Attacks:
- Enforce **strong, complex passwords**.
- Regularly rotate passwords for service accounts.
- Monitor **Kerberos ticket request anomalies** (e.g., volume of TGS or AS-REQ requests).
- Use **Managed Service Accounts (MSAs/gMSAs)** for automation instead of static service accounts.
- Disable the ‚ÄúDo not require Kerberos preauthentication‚Äù flag for all users unless explicitly required.

## üé≠ Real-World Analogies

### üîê Kerberoasting Analogy

> Imagine you work in a company (domain) and have a valid employee badge (credentials). You know that there's a **locked file cabinet (service)** and anyone can request the **key** from the receptionist ‚Äî but this key is **encrypted using the cabinet owner‚Äôs password**.

As an insider, you request that key, take it home, and try every possible combination (offline cracking) to figure out the cabinet owner's password. If it's weak, you'll break in and now you have access to the **service account's password**.

---

### üîì AS-REP Roasting Analogy

> Now imagine someone **outside the company** (unauthenticated attacker) sends a request to the receptionist pretending to be "John from accounting" ‚Äî who, due to poor policy, doesn't require any ID (no pre-authentication).

The receptionist **hands over an encrypted key**, assuming it's for John. But you, the attacker, use it to try and **crack John's password offline**. If it's weak, you're in ‚Äî without ever having stepped inside the company.

## üß† When to Use Which?

| Scenario                                | Recommended Attack        | Why                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You have **domain user credentials**    | ‚úÖ **Kerberoasting**       | You can query SPNs and request TGS tickets with minimal privileges. |
| You have **no credentials at all**      | ‚úÖ **AS-REP Roasting**     | AS-REP roasting can be done anonymously if misconfigured users exist.|
| Target has **many SPN accounts**        | ‚úÖ **Kerberoasting**       | Large ADs often have many exposed service accounts.                 |
| You want **low-noise, quick access**    | ‚úÖ **AS-REP Roasting**     | Fast, easy, no domain access needed, good for stealthy enumeration. |
| Red team in **initial recon phase**     | ‚úÖ **AS-REP Roasting**     | Useful for password spraying with zero credentials.                 |
| Already have **foot in the door**       | ‚úÖ **Kerberoasting**       | Elevate privileges by cracking service accounts.                    |

## Quick Detection Command

### Detect AS-REP Roasting Vulnerable Users

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter {DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $true} -Properties DoesNotRequirePreAuth
```

### List Accounts with SPNs (Kerberoastable)

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -eq $null} -Properties ServicePrincipalName
```

## ‚úÖ Red Team Strategy Tip

- üîé **Start with AS-REP Roasting** if you're outside the domain or doing recon.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Use Kerberoasting** once you're inside to target valuable service accounts.
